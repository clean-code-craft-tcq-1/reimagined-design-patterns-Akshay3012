# reimagined-design-patterns

Give a summary description of Four design patterns that you choose from the following design patterns: **Adapter,  Builder, Composite, Decorator, Observer, Interpreter, State, Mediator, Memento, Prototype, Proxy**. In your summaries say:

- what kind of problem(s) you can solve with that pattern and when you use it, maybe with a short example
- how the pattern works, what the basic idea of the pattern is
- what the main advantage and what the the main disadvantage is of using this pattern
- Write a short summary for each of the four patterns, about half a page for each pattern (rather less than more). 

> Do not add diagrams, and do not try to give a complete description of the patterns as found in the books. Rather think of how you would explain the essential ideas of these patterns in a few sentences to a colleague while drinking coffee.

# **Adapter Design Pattern**
Adapter pattern works as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces and acts as a software design pattern that allows the interface of an existing class to be used as another interface.

**Example/Usecase :** Consider Charging your mobile phone, You need to connect one end to mobile Type C or Type B and other other end to Power Supply via adapter, Charger directly can not be connected to power supply without an adapter.

**Advantages :** Flexibility in design (New adapters can be added without disturbing the existing code)

**Disadvantage :** Increases the complexity of code when more number of interfaces are added.
